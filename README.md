# Basic-movie-recommendation-system
Hello guys!

This particular repository contains a basic movie recommendation system for beginners.

Brief
* The Simple Recommender offers generalized recommendations to every user based on movie popularity and (sometimes) genre.
* The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
* This model does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.

The datatset I used is the famous movie lens dataset from Kaggle
